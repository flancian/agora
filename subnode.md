# Subnode

- A subnode is any piece of content that an [[agora]] user contributes; most commonly as of the time of writing ([[2020-11-17]]) a note in Markdown format, but eventually very likely any piece of media.
- Subnodes are contained in [[node]]s, which are the heart of the [[agora]].
- What you are reading right now is a [[subnode]]. If you look below or above, you will see other notes taken by other users -- these are all different subnodes in the same [[node]], which happens to be called 'subnode' in this particular case :)
