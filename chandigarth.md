# Chandigarth
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh
- A planned city, like [[Brasilia]]
- It was one of the early [planned cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_cities) in post-independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh#cite_note-ci2-10) The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier), which transformed from earlier plans created by the Polish architect [Maciej Nowicki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maciej_Nowicki_(architect)) and the American planner [Albert Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mayer_(planner)). Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by the Chandigarh Capital Project Team headed by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier), [Jane Drew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Drew) and [Maxwell Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Fry). In 2015, an article published by [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) named Chandigarh as one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernization.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh#cite_note-11)
