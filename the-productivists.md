  - "We’re a group of personal knowledge management (PKM) and productivity enthusiasts coming together to help everyone get more done in less time and with less stress. And we talk a little philosophy and theory of PKM along the way. :wink: We believe in productivity as a powerful tool to help support a life well lived, and balance is key! So we hope you’ll stick around and find new ideas, workflows, tools, and inspiration to help you in spending more of your time focused on the things you love."
