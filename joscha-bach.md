# Joscha Bach
- A [[person]] on [[twitter]]: @plinz.
- Seems like an all-around nice guy. I agree with most (everything?) I've heard him say, so far.
- Conversation with [[Lex Fridman]]
  - Born/raised in East Germany ([[outsider]])
  - Thinks social networks should become Agoras -- although, of course, he doesn't use that terminology.

  - Neurons, like all cells, are like individual organisms evolved to reap rewards; they self-adjust to trigger on the right stimuli, which results in them being "reinforced": getting fatter.
  - Doesn't believe in the self/identity; probably an advanced meditator.
  - One's attention is focused by default on instances in which our internal models of the world fail to predict it accurately. In a sense introspection and fascination with mental processes is a symptom of maladjustment.
