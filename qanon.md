- In July 2020, Twitter banned thousands of QAnon-affiliated accounts and changed its algorithms to reduce the theory's spread.
- The conspiracy theory, disseminated mainly by supporters of Trump as **The Storm** and **The Great Awakening**—QAnon's precepts and vocabulary are closely related to the religious concepts of [millenarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism) and [apocalypticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypticism),[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-salon0819-31) leading it to be sometimes construed as an emerging religious movement
- Followers of QAnon also believe that there is an imminent event known as "The Storm", in which thousands of people, members of the cabal, will be arrested, possibly sent to [Guantanamo Bay prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base) or to face military tribunals, and the U.S. military will brutally take over the country.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-salon0819-31) The result of The Storm will be salvation and utopia on earth.
- Q has accused many liberal Hollywood actors, [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)) politicians, and high-ranking officials of being members of the cabal. Q also claimed that Trump feigned conspiracy with Russians to enlist [Robert Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller) to join him in exposing the ring and preventing a [coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) by [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama), [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton), and [George Soros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-15)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-:4-16)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-:10-17) "Q" is a reference to the [Q clearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_clearance) used by the U.S. Department of Energy.
- There has been much speculation about the motives and identity of Q. A range of attribution theories credit Q posts to either a military intelligence officer, Trump himself, or an [alternate reality game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game) by [Cicada 3301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon#cite_note-:3-12) The Italian leftist [Wu Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Ming) foundation has speculated that QAnon is inspired by the [Luther Blissett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_(nom_de_plume)) persona, which leftists and anarchists used to organize pranks, media stunts, and hoaxes in the 1990s. "Blissett" published the novel __[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(novel))__ in 1999. [[Wu Ming]]
