- 
swelling, bruising or local bleeding 

-

- 
swollen and tender glands in the groin or armpit of the bitten limb 

- 
faintness, dizziness 

- 
nausea and vomiting 

-

-

- oozing of blood from the bite site or gums 

-

What to do Pressure bandage & immobilise 
1 Follow DRSABCD. 2 Call triple zero (000) for an ambulance. 3 Lie the patient down and ask them to keep still. 
Reassure the patient. 

4 If on a limb, apply an elasticised roller bandage (10–15 cm wide) over the bite site as soon as possible. 
5 Apply a further elasticised roller bandage (10–15 cm wide), starting just above the fingers or toes and moving upwards on the bitten limb as far as can be reached. 
- 
Use clothing or other material if an elasticised roller bandage is not available. 

- 
Apply the bandage as firmly as possible to the limb. You should be unable to easily slide a finger between the bandage and the skin. 



6 Immobilise the bandaged limb using splints. 
7 Keep the patient lying down and completely still (immobilised). 


8 Write down the time of the bite and when the bandage was applied. If possible, mark the location of the bite site (if known) on the skin with a pen, or photograph the site. Do not wash venom off the skin or clothes because it may assist identification. 
9 Stay with the patient until medical aid arrives.
