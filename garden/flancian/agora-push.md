# Agora Push

- As of the time of writing ([[2020-11-25]]), the Agora works exclusively on a pull model: it constantly tries to pull updates from all participating [[digital garden]]s. This is simple and works well enough but might not scale.
- Pushes could fix this. Garden owners could set up some sort of push protocol so that, on each garden update, their note taking tools or their git host ([[github]] is currently the most popular) let the Agora know that there are updates to be pulled. By doing this, they might get better refresh latency.
