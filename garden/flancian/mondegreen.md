# Mondegreen

- A [[misheard]] name.
- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen
  - "A mondegreen /ˈmɒndɪɡriːn/ is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to clearly hear a lyric, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense."
- As a creative technique, I try to keep track of things I mishear and think about they could mean in [[Flancia]].
