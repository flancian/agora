# Flancian's digital garden

Welcome to my [[digital garden]]!

This garden is part of the [Agora](https://anagora.org/node/agora) and can be found rendered in https://anagora.org/. If you're viewing this on Github, you will have a suboptimal experience (many links will be broken).

If you'd like help setting up a digital garden like this one for yourself, please reach out to me in any way you find convenient: [[identity]].

For more information about my other projects, please refer to https://flancia.org.
