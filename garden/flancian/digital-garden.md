# Digital Garden

- A digital garden is a loose collection of hyperlinked notes (personal, or project scoped) that are maintained over long periods of time; like if you were tending to a garden over the years.
- Digital gardens benefit from [[compounding effect]]s: they gain usefulness over time.
  - Hypothesis: their usefulness goes up superlinearly w.r.t. nodes added, as a lot of the value is in the *networking*: the relations between concepts, events, pieces of information that build up over time.
