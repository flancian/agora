    - 0-10 minutes: tidy workspace, file away notes, get all tasks into task management
    - 10-20 review completed tasks, calendar, notes and goals. Compare plan to what happened.
    - 20-35 review progress on top priorities. What needs to be updated?
    - 35-50 what are your most important tasks and events each day the following week?
    - 50-60 review your 'someday maybe' list. **What things are you excited about? What new things do you want to learn?**

- Reflect: "I was derailed in my writing this week by several unexpected meetings. I'll speak to my manager about minimizing these occurrences so I can focus.”
- Obvious time to do it is Friday afternoon. Doing it then lets you "clean up" and go into the weekend confident that you are in a good shape.
- On Sunday evening, the work week looms large, and we already have Monday on our minds. You can channel that anxiety.
- On Monday morning, you are refreshed; you can use it to ease into the week.
- **Be kind to yourself.**
- [[David Allen]]: "the weekly review is the critical success factor for marrying your larger commitments to your day-to-day activities."
