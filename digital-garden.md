# Digital Garden

A **digital garden** is a personal website or knowledge base that grows slowly over time. Unlike a blog, which is chronologically sorted and "finished", a garden is:

*   **Evergreen**: Content is constantly updated and refined.
*   **Interconnected**: Notes are linked together heavily (using [[wikilinks]]), creating a web of thought rather than a stream.
*   **Personal**: It reflects the gardener's unique way of thinking and organizing the world.
*   **Imperfect**: It welcomes rough notes, drafts, and "seeds" of ideas.

## Why keep a garden?

*   To **learn in public**: Share your notes as you learn, helping others and getting feedback.
*   To **think better**: Writing connects ideas.
*   To **own your data**: A garden is usually a set of simple text files you control, not locked in a platform.

## In the Agora

In this [[Agora]], digital gardens are the primary source of knowledge.
*   Each **[[node]]** (like this one) is a topic or **Agora location**.
*   Each **[[subnode]]** is a post from a specific user's garden about that topic.

When you **[[join]]** the Agora, your garden becomes part of this shared knowledge commons.
