3 Bend the patient well forward and give up to 5 sharp blows on the back between the shoulder blades with the heel of one hand. 
4 Check if the blockage has been removed after each blow. 
5 If the blockage has not cleared after 5 back blows, give up to 5 chest thrusts. 
6 Give chest thrusts by placing one hand in the middle of the patient’s back for support and the heel of the other on the lower half of the sternum. Thrusts should be slower and sharper than CPR compressions.
