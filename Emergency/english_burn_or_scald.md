 
mottled red and white

painful 

 
blistered. Full thickness burns  The area:

What to do If the patients clothing is on fire 
1 Stop the patient from moving around. 
2 Drop the patient to the ground and cover or wrap them in a blanket or similar, if available. 
3 Roll the patient along the ground until the flames are extinguished. 
4 Manage the burn. 

For all burns 
1 Follow DRSABCD. 
2 If the burn is severe or if it involves the airway, call triple zero (000) for an ambulance. 
3 As soon as possible, hold the burnt area under cool running water for 20 minutes. 
4 Remove any clothing and jewellery from the burnt area, unless they are stuck to the burn. 
5 Cover the burn with a light, loose nonstick dressing, preferably clean, dry, non-fluffy material (eg plastic cling film). 
6 Continue to check the patient for shock, and treat if necessary. 
A cold burn is actually tissue damage from extreme cold, thus treatment is different from thermal burns. See the fact sheet on frost bite.
