# Spinal and neck injury 

- 
If the patient is unconscious as a result of a head injury, you should always suspect a spinal injury. 

- 
DO NOT move a patient with a suspected spinal injury unless they are in danger. Movement may cause further injury. 

- 
Twisting, compressing or bending an injured spine may increase the damage. If the patient must be moved, take extreme care to keep the spine straight and avoid twisting or bending. Where the neck is involved, support the head and neck with your hands. 

- 
Do not apply a cervical collar.
