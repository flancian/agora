An asthma emergency is potentially life-threatening. 
Most people who suffer asthma attacks are aware of their asthma and should 
have an action plan and medication. They may wear a medical alert device. In an emergency, or if a patient does not have their own reliever, use another persons reliever (if permitted under local state or territory regulations), or one from a first aid kit.
