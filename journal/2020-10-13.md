# 2020-10-13

 - [[B.]] recomendó [[Gris de Ausencia]] de [[Roberto Cosa]].
 - Tried out [[Tweetdeck]]. Seems FOMO-inducing, but potentially useful as a dashboard.
 - [[Carnivalesque]] was trailblazed by [[Bakhtin]] when critiquing [[Doestoevsky]]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivalesque
 - [[dan-whaley]] forwarded a very interesting email that prompted me to take up work again on [[Agora Protocol]].
 - In the [[Foam]] discord, someone asked about an [[Agora Roadmap]]. Yeah, that makes sense. I sketched one on paper yesterday casually, need to write it down in the [[Agora]] proper.
 - Learnt about [[mathieudutour]], author of the most promising rendering solution for the Agora: https://flancia.org/go/agora-rendering.
 - [[Jay Dugger]] asked me to get back to him in 36 hours about problems of writing: https://twitter.com/JayDugger/status/1315997842968899584 [[todo]] [[2020-10-16]] [[2020-10-17]]
 - [[G.]] suggested I prep a slide deck about the Agora, and also that I give a presentation over Meet about it (perhaps before even having a slide deck). Great idea.
 - Worked on [[Agora publishing]].
