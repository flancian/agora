- [ ] I need to find that email from the [[SP]] party member and get back to them, they were kind.
- [[QAnon]] is really crazy.
- [[idea]] separate '[[TODO]]' and '[[read]]' more clearly. Perhaps also [[buy]].
- [[goto.coop]] is available. Need to a cooperative to register it, though. And perhaps there's no need: [[social.coop]] could run a go links service.
- [[go links]] [[Flanbook]] [[Siphons]] all interact: if people used go links for their social media URLs, they could easily repoint when they switch platforms!
- [ ] Write [[A Naive Plan for a Freer Internet]] for [[social.coop]]: [[go links]] + [[Athens]]+ [[Mastodon]]+ [[ActivityPub]] / backlinking + [[Siphons]] as per [[Flanbook]].
- [[Offline Twitter]]
    - TIL about [[Ted Nelson]]'s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Machines
    - Imagine the productivity boost the world would have if [[Chrome]]'s built in PDF viewer was a bit better: supported annotations (ideally social), docs-like comments, even just remembered where in the PDF you left off on your last visit.
    - Want to set up a [[Twitter]]->[[Mastodon ]][[Siphon]]. Is anybody working on this? (cross post to [[social.coop]])
    - Constructive procrastination (e.g. when you procrastinate on urgent tasks by doing less urgent, but still useful, tasks) feels a lot like flow. Flow fueled by quanta of fear and anger.
    - I feel that, as I integrate my personality, I'm becoming weirder; I like it. It makes sense if you think about it: by integrating N profiles I'm incorporating a wider variety of traits -- thus increasing variance, which likely reduces predictability. One possible outcome: people will like me less (see [[predictable identities]]). I'm willing to take that chance. Let's see how far I can get.
    - Idea: a CLI for the free internet.
        - Perhaps Ipython/colab based to begin. Perhaps a browser extension eventually.
        - Lets you interact with the free internet, that is, that which has open APIs/is not part of a walled garden: Wikipedia. Mastodon. Matrix. Agora.
        - Lets you drive data exchange between supported properties easily; think UNIX pipes.
    - TOL = Thinking Out Loud. A spirit.
        - Cue "school spirit" by Kanye.
    - Flow feels a lot like meditation, indeed.
        - It feels like your brain has reached, or is about to reach, a destination. Like approaching it in the limit, perhaps.

- [[Quick Capture]]
