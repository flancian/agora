- [[codex]] tweeted something very kind that brightened my day: https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1326075446568521729
- [[dr_kvj]] as well: https://twitter.com/dr_kvj/status/1326075716656533505
- Finished [[brightmind]]'s free 8 sessions. Signed up for seven day trial. Reconsider on [[2020-11-15]] [[2020-11-16]], else will be auto charged.
- [[ctietze]] found the framming of bids for wikilinks (nodes) interesting: https://twitter.com/ctietze/status/1326139342599938048.
- [[santicammi]] pointed out the concept of the [[noosphere]] as related to the [[agora]]. Very interesting.
