# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

This *[Agora](https://flancia.org/agora)* is a [[Free]] [[Knowledge]] [[Commons]] built for the benefit of beings.

# Navigating

A quick tour of the Agora might be the best way to communicate its underlying goals and the core concepts behind it:

- A <strong>Node</strong> is the set of community contributions whose titles match an Agora location (i.e. what you searched for or the [[wikilink]] which brought you there).
  - You can see the list of all [[Nodes]] in this Agora.
  - You can also visit special location [[Random]] which will send you to some node out of the many gathered so far.
  - Or read [[Index]], inlined below; it is the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer and more diverse than this one.
- A <strong>User</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources to the Commons, either as part of a repository or individually through social media.
  - You can see the list of all [[Users]] and the nodes they've contributed to.

# Joining

<strong>The Agora is a bit different from most other sites around the internet</strong> in that joining is a two step process that begins elsewhere: 

- First you take notes/write/make posts in the editor(s) or platform(s) of your choice. 
- Then you tell an Agora that you'd like to contribute these resources to the Commons.

## Contributing your personal notes and other writing

- You can contribute to this Agora by taking notes using a personal knowledge management system (like [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]], [[SilverBullet]] or [[Bull]]); storing your notes in a [[Git]] repository (self hosted or with the help of a forge like [[Github]], [[Gitlab]] or [[Codeberg]]); and sending an email to <signup@anagora.org> with the location of your repository and your desired username. Please also review the code of conduct in node [[CONTRACT]], which you are expected to follow.
- Notes can be [[Markdown]], [[Mycomarkup]] or [[Org mode]]. After integration, your notes will be available at the Agora locations matching their filenames as per the node convention described above. This means that if user A links to [[foo]] in a note and user B contributes `foo.md`, following the link in A's writing will surface also user B's resource.

## Posting from social media

You can also contribute to this Agora straight from social media! To do so, you need to follow an [[Agora Bot]] in a supported platform and then post following a convention.

- If you are in Mastodon/the Fediverse, you can follow <https://social.agor.ai/@agora>.
- If you are in [[Bluesky]], you can follow anagora.bsky.social.

Then write posts containing at least one [[wikilink]]; they will be linked in the mentioned nodes. You can additionally opt into storing copies of your messages and #hashtag handling by going through the [[opt in]] process once.

## For more…

- If you don't use any of the above systems but would still like to contribute your writing or other media, please [[reach out]] and we'll try to accommodate your preferred formats and sources!
- See [[Agora chapter]] (2023) for a book chapter on the vision behind the Agora project and what we have accomplished so far.
